## Snapshot

An aspirational, highly motivated and committed tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in software development and programming principles provided by Makers Academy Bootcamp. Well versed in following an Agile workflow and keeping to a clean and precise Test Driven Development process, utilising personally developed testing frameworks in addition to well known frameworks such as Jasmine and RSpec. An excellent team-member with industry standard experience of working on large-scale projects and meeting client deadlines.

## My Introduction to Coding

Throughout my life, until the age of 24(!), I had no idea that Software Engineering was a real career choice. When I was in my early teens, being an avid gamer, I’d always mention to my parents how much I wanted to be a game designer (albeit at that point I had no idea what that would actually entail, but my imagination drew me towards the idea of designing worlds, monsters and heroes). However, my school’s curriculum failed to attractively present the world of computer science and all the wonderful metaphorical doors it can open, so I went down a more 'traditional' route of studying Geography. During my Master’s degree in Environmental Science, I was fortunate enough to work on a module that focussed on dealing with data. Here, I was introduced to Visual Basics for Applications. While it all seemed relatively alien to me at the time, it strangely, all seemed to still make sense. It was this module that opened my eyes to coding (apologies for how cliché that sounded).

This decision brought along the idea of completing a coding bootcamp to allow myself to gain a foothold in the tech industry and start building the career I’d always wanted. Makers Academy being one of the most highly regarded and selective bootcamps in the UK, I decided to submit an application. I completed a Ruby course on Codecademy, and introduced myself to Codewars. I started doing Codewars challenges every day, slowly but surely, learning more and more about programming fundamentals (I thoroughly enjoyed my time ‘grinding’ Codewars problems - maybe something to do with my gaming background or maybe I’m just addicted to seeing that green passing text - I’m not sure..). Nevertheless, I (rather proudly) managed to reach 4kuy in a matter of months and was invited to a technical interview with a Makers coach and by some stroke of luck they accepted me onto their August cohort of 2021. Fair to say that I was over the moon that my coding journey had officially began.

Have a look below for a better idea of what I've gotten up to during my time on the course and how my programming ability has developed over the last (rather intense) 3 months.

## Work Experience

### Arad Research (2018 - 2021)  
_Administrative Officer_

- Gained in-depth knowledge of MS Excel incorporating the use of VBA macros to streamline data handling and formatting.
- Conducted a multitude of interviews over the phone playing a key part in project data acquisition.
- Wrote methodology chapters and literature reviews for evaluation reports prepared for large-scale clients such as the Welsh Government.
- Constructed surveys using various software packages with intricate and complex skip logic.
- Mediated complex discussions between multiple professionals in line with a commissioned project.

### Treganna Primary School (2017 to 2018)  
_Learning Support Assistant_

- I was responsible for aiding autistic children in their learning in a 1:1 environment. 
- It required a considerable amount of patience and creative thinking to accommodate for their learning difficulties, and further improve the child’s capacity to learn.

### Professional Musician (2016 to 2017)  
_Guitarist for professional singer_

- Toured with renowned folk musician, Sian James.
- Performances of a high quality pristine nature that required dedicated practice and
commitment to maintain the standard the paying audience had come to expect.
- Performed abroad in various festivals held in exotic locations, such as Uzbekistan
and Canada.


## Education

### Makers Academy (July 2021 to November 2021)
_Intensive Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp_
- Participated in consistent pair programming and team engineering projects
- Object Oriented Principles, Test Driven Development, Model View Controller, Domain Driven Development
- Methodologies: Agile/XP
- Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL
- Frameworks: React, Rails, Django

### Aberystwyth University (September 2012 to September 2016)
_MSc Environmental Change, Impact, and Adaptation_
- I produced a dissertation under the tuition of Professor Mark Whitehead on psychological barriers inhibiting effective climate change mitigation.
- Two modules required in-depth use of Microsoft Excel, constructing macros on Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in order to deal with extensive data sets. I found both modules exceptionally rewarding and have been using a variety of the techniques learned throughout my current employment. 

_BSc Geography_
- The broad and expansive nature of my undergraduate modules aided me significantly in developing effective techniques in report writing, verbal presentations on MS Powerpoint, and dealing with numerical and statistical data on MS Excel, Minitab and ArcGIS. Collectively, they were an essential part of my learning and assisted me throughout my postgraduate degree. 


## Hobbies

- CodeWars (currently rank 4kyu and in the top 10% of CodeWars members since starting properly in February 2021)
- Competitive gamer (reached top 1% of European players on multiple games, such as League of Legends, World of Warcraft, StarCraft 2, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite, and Tetris(!))
- Staying active by attending the gym and playing football, reached the top division of the most competitive (non-professional) 5-a-side league in Cardiff.
